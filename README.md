# Machine-Learning-Project
Robot Vision 

This project is based on the IIT iCub robot-vision system that is described in the article ‘Is Deep Learning Safe for Robot Vision?’

We want create a code that reads the input video and recognizes some objects in the frame.

The final file of the project are DataSetGen, CNN_cluster, Classifier_get_train and Model.

Old_Dataset is a previous version of DataSetGen.

example_of_one-versus-all and example_of_video_input.py are example.
